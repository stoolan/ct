## Intent

This is more about comments than code, compiling this program on its own is fairly useless.
But, it is doable. Read below for guidelines if you want to execute!

## Requirements

Python 3, with requirements installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And clone down the repo :

```bash
git clone this-repo@github.com
```

## Execution

There isn't really a deliverable here, just a bunch of numbers that get computed.

I ran the data in as tests, you can run them like so:
```bash

pytest test.py # use -s flag to print logs to stdout
```
